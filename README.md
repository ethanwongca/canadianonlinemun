## üõ† Languages and Libraries

### **Bots:**

- **[Python 3](https://www.python.org/doc/)**: The primary programming language used for developing the bots due to its simplicity and extensive libraries.
- **[Discord.py (v1.7.3)](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)**: A Python library used for interacting with the Discord API. It provides an easy way to create bots that can communicate with users on Discord servers.
- **[Asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)**: Used for writing concurrent code with the async/await syntax. It is essential for handling multiple tasks, such as processing user commands and responding to them in real-time.
- **[Nest_asyncio](https://github.com/erdewit/nest_asyncio)**: A small Python library that allows asyncio to be used in environments that have an already running asyncio event loop (like Jupyter notebooks).
- **[Time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html)**: A standard Python library for manipulating time-related tasks like setting timers, measuring execution time, and delaying actions.

### **Website:**

- **[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)**: Used for adding interactivity to the website, including button transitions and dynamic content updates.
- **[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)**: Used for styling the website to create a visually appealing and responsive design.
- **[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)**: The backbone of the website, used for structuring the content and elements.
